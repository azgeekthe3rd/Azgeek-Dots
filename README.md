# Azgeek-Dots
This is my Arch Linux rice; keep in mind that not all of the packages and programs I use are listed in this repository because they have little to no configuration, thus their inclusion is insignificant. Make sure to have bumblebee-status installed before copying the files. Also, I apologize for any inconvenience. Let me know if you face any errors.
